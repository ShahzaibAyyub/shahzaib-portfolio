## How to Run the Project

This is a static portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can run it in either of the following ways:

- **Option 1: Open directly in a browser**
  1. Download or clone the project.
  2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

- **Option 2: Use a simple local server (recommended)**
  - **Using VS Code Live Server extension**
    1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
    2. Install the "Live Server" extension if you don't have it.
    3. Right‑click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
  - **Using Python (already installed on most systems)**
    1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
    2. Run one of the following commands:
       - Python 3:
         ```bash
         python3 -m http.server 5500
         ```
       - Python (if `python3` is not available):
         ```bash
         python -m http.server 5500
         ```
    3. Open `http://localhost:5500` in your browser.

Once the site is open in your browser, you can navigate through the portfolio pages and sections normally.
